       I chose to do an instructable on how to teach your dog to crawl because I think this is a good example of how easy it is to train a dog. With so many animals being dropped off by their owners due to owners being <b>overwhelmed</b>, I think its important for people to know that you can get a dog under control.

       Special thanks to Brian Iltis for telling Kodiak to crawl so that I could make a GIF of him.
