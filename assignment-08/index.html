       <li>Yourself</li>

      <p>
        The first thing you are going to want to do is take your treats and sit on the ground with your legs bent and out in front of you. You'll want your legs bent enough so that your dog can fit under them. Then have your dog lay down next to you and give them treats so they know they want to be on the ground.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Step Two" class="container">
     <h2>Step Two</h2>

     <p>
Next, you'll want to take your hand that is farthest from your pup and slip them treats by reaching under your legs. As soon as they know to look under your legs for the treats, start slowly moving that hand out from under your legs. It might take a few dozen times for your dog to start following your hand under you instead of trying to jump over you. Be patient, and whatever you do, don't reward them unless they went under your legs. This is what forces them to start crawling. Once they reach the other side, reward them by saying "good crawl!" They should only hear that command after they start that action. Make sure that you take breaks if your dog loses interest. Do several sets of this throughout the day before you move on. They should be confidently crawling under you before step three.

    <div id="Step Three" class="container">
     <h2>Step Three</h2>

     <p>
       Step three is where you introduce the command in the beginning, rather than when you give the treat. You should no longer have to guide your hand under your bent legs. Let your dog crawl under you on their own, then when your dog is confident, stand up and ask them to crawl. Don't expect this to work right away, but after a few tries and a few reminders that involve sitting back down, your dog should get it. This would normally be the stopping point, but if your goal is to have them crawl farther than a few feet, your going to need to hold off on rewarding your dog until they have gone a little further. Increase that distance each time you practice, and your dog should be crawling across your room, across your home, or across your front yard!
