<p>Today, my favorite song is Sugar Honey Iced Tea (S.H.I.T) by Princess Nokia. This song commands respect and gives me a confident feeling when listening to it. I appreciate Princess Nokia's work, and I'm glad she has gotten more and more recognition over the past few years.

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>Sugar honey iced tea <br>
These bitches don't like me<br>
These bitches wanna fight me<br>
And doin' shit just to spite me<br>
<br>
I see them talking on the IG<br>
Think you jealous maybe high key<br>
I got the juice I got the high seat<br>
Do I care? Unlikely<br>
<br>
You must have time on your hands<br>
'Cause all the time you been hatin'<br>
I know you're mad that I'm famous<br>
I know you're mad that I made it<br>
When all the time you been hatin'<br>
<br>
You could've turned into something<br>
Sometimes it works out for people<br>
Sometimes it really just doesn't<br>
Don't do this shit to be famous<br>
I do this shit 'cause I love it<br>
I shot an arrow said "Fuck it"<br>
<br>
I took a chance, came from nothing<br>
You have to go for it, want it<br>
You have to rise up above it<br>
If you go on expecting<br>
Well girl I think that you're buggin'<br>
<br>
How you want what I have?<br>
You ain't workin' yourself<br>
That toxic energy shit<br>
Ain't really good for your health<br>
I think you need better goals<br>
<br>
'Cause oh my God you seem lost<br>
You talkin' shit 'bout my music<br>
But what the fuck have you dropped?<br>
<br>
Now what the fuck have you done?<br>
Accolades, you have none<br>
Your lazy ways get you none<br>
I'll go and pray for you hun<br>
<br>
Sugar honey iced tea<br>
These bitches don't like me<br>
These bitches wanna fight me<br>
And doin' shit just to spite me<br>
<br>
I see them talking on the IG<br>
Think you jealous maybe high key<br>
I got the juice I got the high seat<br>
Do I care? Unlikely<br>
<br>
I'm on the train throwing soup<br>
The racist men making threats<br>
I'm not gangster but I can tell you I love<br>
To throw hands on racists, bigots and scum<br>
<br>
I don't like drama, it's dumb<br>
I don't be fightin' no women<br>
I don't be totin no guns<br>
I hate domestic abusers<br>
<br>
In fact they all make me sick<br>
This dude poured wine on my friend<br>
I punched him straight in his shit<br>
I got a real code of honor<br>
<br>
That I take seriously<br>
If Colin Kap was a woman then I'd be dead on one knee<br>
My revolution is soulful<br>
I'm healing kids with my hands<br>
I'm talkin' loving my people<br>
<br>
Not fighting bitches for brands<br>
I got no hate in my heart<br>
I think it's funny I rap<br>
I did not bang in these streets<br>
And I did not trap in the trap<br>
<br>
Sugar honey iced tea<br>
These bitches don't like me<br>
These bitches wanna fight me<br>
And doin' shit just to spite me<br>
I see them talking on the IG<br>
Think you jealous maybe high key<br>
I got the juice I got the high seat<br>
Do I care? Unlikely<br>
