Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment

There are many useful attributes for each element of a page. The first attribute is a div, which is used to group elements together. Divs help with structural clarity and grouping elements together. Divs are great for organizing, and help the code flow. Inside the div lives the id, which is used to identify an element. Ids don't show on the webpage, but are important in understanding what belongs in that div. Classes, or class attributes, are used to group similar types of elements together. These can be descriptions for how things look, function, or the purpose. Unlike ids, you can have more than one class element. The last element is a span. Spans are used for extra styling, and can be used multiple times in a div.

Alt text is the alternative text attribute. It is used by screen readers for people who are visually impaired. This important so that everyone visiting a website may gain the information that is intended to be given on that website.

My work cycle for this assignment was to first read the overall assignment, then review the module. After that, I added the basic structure of the website and thought about what song to use. I added in the devs and headings first, so that I would have a clear understanding of where the rest of the information needed to go. I then found the web pages for the content I was sharing on the site (youtube, soundcloud, etc) and copied and pasted the embedded code. I added descriptions to what might need a description, and finished off with the tedious parts (adding line breaks to the lyrics). Right before submitting, I remembered that I needed to add the alt text to my image and went back to add that.
