The web is very different from the internet. The internet is the "internetwork" or a global network of smaller networks. This is the connection of all IP addresses. The web is the information that is accessed through the internet. So the websites, text, photos and more that you access aren't the internet itself, but the web information stored and accessed on the internet. The internet is the hardware while the web is the software. 
The internet works through a series of connections, not a cloud. These internet is connected through wires, sometimes satellites and cell phone providers. Different servers with information are connected to these wires with different addresses known as IP addresses. The computer that I use accesses these servers through my wifi, which has a line running to my internet service provider, or ISP. This ISP is plugged into larger wires that indirectly connect to the servers that I want to reach (Google, facebook, Moodle, etc). When I post something on facebook, that post can be viewed around the world due to the fact that there are huge fiber optic wires in the ocean connecting different continents so that the whole world is connected. Packets are used to send larger files that are too big to send as one entity. This allows a breakup of one file, the shipment of those parts, and the reassembly of that file at its destination. All of this gets to the right place due to the IP addresses. Even cellphones have IP addresses. Routers help the process as well by directing the packets towards their correct destination. 
A directory is a filing system. They are organized in a hierarchy where a root directory acts as a top "folder" and whichever subdirectory your on is the active directory. This organization is critical when building a website. While most people save information to "files" on their computer, the website form of this is a directory. This makes more sense, as a phone directory is accessed by the public while a filing cabinet in your home is private to the residents in your home. 
VCS, or version control system, is beneficial because it streamlines the working and collaborative process. Its fast, provides a history of all of the files and each of their changes, and organizes and labels who made those changes. It is important to have this kind of interface when working on creating something with a team. On a regular system, person a would not be able to fix the same problem as person b in a different way without mixing up the entire project. VCS allows for trial and error, creativity, and collaboration.
