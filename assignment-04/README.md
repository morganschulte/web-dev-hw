# Assignment-04
## Morgan Schulte

Visiting The Wayback Machine, I went to IMDB.com from 2005. Though my most visited websites now are mostly social media, research/school, banking, and tech websites, back when I was in elementary school, I would go on IMDB to find out what movie I wanted to rent. I completely forgot that this is what the website looked like. Like most websites in 2005, the fonts were all the same. It looked a lot like my assignment 4 website if I knew just a little more about coding. The banners are minimal, the only way to emphasize content is to put it higher on the page. It is simple, nostalgic, and ugly. IMBD is now a lot more visually pleasing. Photos are emphasized over text. The flow of the website seems more natural.

The GIT Module is more straightforward than I thought it would be. I'm still trying to get a firm grasp on everything I have learned through this class. I'm hoping that like any language, understanding for coding and web design will come through repetition. I really appreciate the walkthrough videos. They're incredibly helpful.
