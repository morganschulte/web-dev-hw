    <h1>Still I Rise</h1>
    <h2>Maya Angelou</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      You may write me down in history<br />
With your bitter, twisted lies,<br />
You may trod me in the very dirt<br />
But still, like dust, I'll rise.<br />

Does my sassiness upset you?<br />
Why are you beset with gloom?<br />
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br />
Pumping in my living room.<br />

Just like moons and like suns,<br />
With the certainty of tides,<br />
Just like hopes springing high,<br />
Still I'll rise.<br />

Did you want to see me broken?<br />
Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br />
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,<br />
Weakened by my soulful cries?<br />

Does my haughtiness offend you?<br />
Don't you take it awful hard<br />
’Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines<br />
Diggin’ in my own backyard.<br />

You may shoot me with your words,<br />
You may cut me with your eyes,<br />
You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br />
But still, like air, I’ll rise.<br />

Does my sexiness upset you?<br />
Does it come as a surprise<br />
That I dance like I've got diamonds<br />
At the meeting of my thighs?<br />

Out of the huts of history’s shame<br />
I rise
Up from a past that’s rooted in pain<br />
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br />

Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br />
I rise
Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear<br />
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br />

I rise<br />

I rise<br />

I rise.<br />
