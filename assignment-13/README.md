# Assignment-13 FINAL
## Morgan Schulte

This entire class was new to me in terms of Web Development. I had no prior experience and didn't know GitHub existed.

Web design was a little different. I know that things need borders from composition in other artforms. I also knew color theory, and some information on choosing fonts.

I based this site off of my last one in structure, but wanted an entirely different feel. I chose a cool grey color palette so that it wouldn't compete with photos. I also added rounded edges to everything so it would look clean. I decided to make a photography website for myself, so I went into Lightroom and chose around ten photos for each category of photography that I wanted to showcase. I then went to work on figuring out the menu with the new pages that I would have. I uploaded photos into all of my portfolio pages. I wanted those to be entirely visual and let the images speak for themselves. I then wrote what I wanted in my about page and went on to the contact page. I did the inspiration page last, as I forgot that I needed an iframe so I had to think of what I would link. That's when I decided to write about the three women who inspire me in photography. I made sure that their names would link to their sites. I then added details and reviewed everything before pushing it to GitHub.
