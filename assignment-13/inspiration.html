<h1> The Artists Who Inspire Me </h1>
<h3> I wouldn't be the artist I am today without these mentors, collaborators, and friends. </h3>
<br>
<a href="https://www.paperandinkstudio.com/home" class="link">Marcy James</a>
<p>Marcy James was by far my favorite instructor at Rocky Mountain School of Photography. Her passion, humor, and spirit was contagious. She inspired me to make creativity a <i>habit</i> and to use my camera every day.</p>

<a href="http://theresaisabear.com/" class="link">Theresa Bear</a>
<p> I met Theresa Bear at Rocky Mountain School of Photography when she was a studio assistant. Her love of nature, playfulness, and creativity helped me broaden my interests in the visual arts. Her use of floral elements in her own work is astounding. She continues to inspire me today. </p>

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/makcrist/?hl=en" class="link">Mak Crist</a>
<p>Mak is one of my closest friends and biggest inpirations. Her work ethic is unmatched. Currently a head photographer at KUHL, Mak travels the world in search of beautiful moments to share with the world. Her eye for photography constantly surprises me. Even with her incredible success early on, Mak continues to work hard and earn her spot amoungst some of the biggest names in outdoor photography. I can always count on her for a good critique, and even better, a GFC at Plonk with a good thirty minutes of planning to crush the photography patriarchy.</p>
